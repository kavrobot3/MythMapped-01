      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Content Designer & Creator of MythMapped<br>
      <strong>Grade:</strong> 7, Warangal</p>
      <p>Hi! I’m Raeyansh Agarwal, a 7th grader from Warangal with a deep passion for exploring global myths, legends, and cultures. 
        I came up with the idea for MythMapped as a way to bring together ancient stories, forgotten traditions, and the fascinating heritage of different civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>As the content designer, I focused on selecting the stories, structuring the website, and writing engaging, informative content. 
        My goal was to make these legends accessible and fun for readers of all ages. 
        Every myth featured on the site was carefully chosen and written to spark curiosity and wonder.

      <h3>Kavish Agarwal</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Programmer, Visual designer & Creator of MythMapped<br>
      <strong>Grade:</strong> 8, Warangal</p>
      <p>Hi! I’m Kavish Agarwal, an 8th grader from Warangal and the lead developer behind MythMapped. 
        While Raeyansh imagined and designed the content, I brought the technical side to life and design it. 
        From designing the layout and making sure the website is user-friendly, to handling coding and optimizing it for different devices, I managed everything needed to turn our vision into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was both challenging and exciting. It allowed me to grow my programming skills and see how tech can help connect people with the stories of the past. 
        I’m proud of what we’ve built together and hope you enjoy exploring the world of myths with us!

          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            We’re two students from Warangal — Raeyansh and Kavish — who believe that mythology is more than just stories. 
            It’s a mirror into our shared human past. At MythMapped, we're blending history, geography, storytelling, and culture 
            into one interactive platform where ancient tales meet modern curiosity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a fun idea between cousins became a passion project. We aren’t historians or developers (yet), 
            just two learners who wanted to bring myths to life on a map and help others explore them in a new way.

          <h2>About MythMapped</h2>
          <p>
            MythMapped is a unique initiative that maps world mythology geographically. From the serpent gods of Mesoamerica 
            to the forest spirits of Eastern Europe and the cosmic battles of India, we wanted to visually represent how these 
            powerful stories are rooted in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to make myths more interactive and accessible. Using timelines, regional cards, and quizzes, 
            MythMapped isn’t just a website — it’s a journey through the imagination and heritage of humanity.
